Name: Isabelle Dionisius
Discord Username: Isabelle
## Where I live
I live in the US, in the State of New York, in Westchester County.
## Programming Experience: 
I have been coding for many years. As a computer science teacher I like to play around with new programming concepts and code. Although, I am new to Kotlin, I am skilled with Swift and Java.
## My goals and interests
My goals are to become a better developer and to write some side projects (either for me or for others) besides my full time job as a teacher. Becoming a better coder is also beneficial for my teaching skills. The more I know the better I can teach:)

I am a passionate runner and sewer. I also like to cook as often as I can.
